🧠 Summary

The SDK exposes sensitive data, uses insecure patterns (any, unhandled errors, console logging), and swallows exceptions in decryption routines.
These behaviors may lead to information leakage, runtime instability, and reduced type safety in production builds.

🚨 Critical Issue 1 — Sensitive Key Exposure

Files:

src/FhevmDecryptionSignature.ts

src/fhevmTypes.ts

src/react/useFHEDecrypt.ts

Severity: 🔴 High / Security
Description:
Variables or constants referencing privateKey or mnemonic appear in code and are not clearly isolated in secure storage.
In the context of FHEVM, exposing cryptographic key material within SDK layers could lead to memory disclosure or key reuse vulnerabilities.

Recommendation:

Remove or mask sensitive key variables.

Use environment variables or secure in-memory handling.

Add a static analyzer rule to block committing secrets.

⚠️ Issue 2 — Silent Error Handling in useFHEDecrypt

File: src/react/useFHEDecrypt.ts
Severity: 🟠 Medium / Logic
Description:
A try/catch block captures an error but never rethrows or reports it.
This causes silent failure during decryption, leading to undefined states for applications using this hook.

Recommendation:

try {
  // ...
} catch (err) {
  console.error("FHE decrypt failed", err);
  throw err; // rethrow to allow app-level error handling
}


⚠️ Issue 3 — Excessive Console Logging (Info Leak Risk)

Files:

src/internal/RelayerSDKLoader.ts

src/internal/fhevm.ts

src/react/useFhevm.tsx

Severity: 🟠 Medium / Information Disclosure
Description:
console.log statements are present throughout internal modules.
These may print FHE-encrypted payloads, API endpoints, or intermediate state objects in production builds.

Recommendation:

Remove console.log calls in release builds.

Replace with a proper logger (e.g., debug flag or conditional logging).

Add ESLint rule no-console to enforce.

⚙️ Issue 4 — Widespread any Type Usage

Files (sample):

src/FhevmDecryptionSignature.ts

src/fhevmTypes.ts

src/internal/RelayerSDKLoader.ts

src/internal/fhevmTypes.ts

src/react/useFHEDecrypt.ts

src/react/useFHEEncryption.ts

src/react/useFhevm.tsx

Severity: 🟡 Low / Maintainability
Description:
The SDK heavily relies on any types, disabling static safety.
Potential runtime type errors may occur during encryption/decryption or contract interactions.

Recommendation:

Enable noImplicitAny and strict in tsconfig.json.

Define explicit FHE type interfaces (e.g., FHEEncrypted<T>, FHESigner).

⚙️ Issue 5 — Catch Block Without Rethrow (Swallowed Error)

File: src/react/useFHEDecrypt.ts
Severity: 🟡 Low / Logic
Description:
Catching without rethrow or logging hides runtime issues, breaking error propagation chains.

Recommendation:
Always log or rethrow errors.

📊 Summary Table
Category	Files Affected	Severity	Description
Sensitive key variables	3	🔴 High	Possible key disclosure
Silent catch (no rethrow)	1	🟠 Medium	Hidden runtime failures
Console logging in SDK	3	🟠 Medium	Information leak risk
any type usage	8	🟡 Low	Type safety loss
🧾 Suggested Mitigation Plan

Enable strict TypeScript mode ("strict": true, "noImplicitAny": true).

Add ESLint rule no-console and CI enforcement.

Centralize key management (move to secure provider / env variables).

Audit all error handling to ensure errors are logged or surfaced.

Add pnpm test cases for encrypt/decrypt error propagation.
